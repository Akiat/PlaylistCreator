# PlaylistCreator

A program which convert your deezer playlists to m3u playlists according to what you have locally.

PlaylistCreator scans your music folder to find your deezer playlist songs. Works with flac, mp3...

It was a program for my usage, there is no config file, nothing is polished but that works if you modify the MainClass.java with your music folder.

The program was designed to manage multi-user and multi platform (deezer, spotify...), so if you want to add other platforms it will be relatively simple.

Maybe I will finish it a day... But I have no time for it at this moment.

I stopped the development of this app in the middle of nowhere, so there is a begin of GUI, lot of debug and surely lot of bug. But if it can be helpful to someone !
